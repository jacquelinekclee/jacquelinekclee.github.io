description: For my final project for an elective I took called <a href = "https://afraenkel.github.io/fairness-algo-decision/">Fairness and Algorithmic Decision Making</a>, I chose to explore potential inequities in how the Civilian Complaint Review Board investigates civilian complaints made against New York Police Department officers. Using Logistic Regression, I modeled the CCRB's decision making process, which decides whether a complaint against an officer is substantiated (leading to repercussions for the officer) or not. I then audited it by assessing whether the model meets various metrics of fairness, like demographic parity, when looking at the ruling on a complaint and the civilian's ethnicity. With this investigation, I hoped to demonstrate the importance of auditing Data Science models and some various methods to do so. Please see the <a href = "https://github.com/jacquelinekclee/algorithmic-audit-nyc-ccrb/blob/aa536a7c4a71f71eaf114cd817be665e8a0b5252/paper2.pdf">full paper</a> or the repository linked above to read more details on the data, model, and audit performed.
finding1: Performed data wrangling, statistical tests, and fairness audit to identify and investigate inequity in how allegations against police officers are ruled on based on complainant ethnicity.
finding2: Evaluated model fairness by testing different thresholds to see how they satisfy various parity measures and calculating model utility. 
finding3: Emphasized need for fairness audits of Data Science applications, especially when models deal with human data or when model performance can change based on priority.
