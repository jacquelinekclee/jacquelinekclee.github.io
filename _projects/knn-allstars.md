description: Becoming an NBA All Star has several implications for players' contracts, careers, and legacies. Currently, who becomes an all star is 50% dependent on fan votes and the remaining 50% is split evenly by the current players and selected members of the media. In this process, there is a lot of room for subjectivity, and many deserving players may be overlooked due to reasons outside of their play on the court. With this project, I wanted to investigate how well player statistics could determine who should be an all star, understand any underrated or overrated players, and perhaps make a case for the NBA to introduce some form of objective, numeric measure into the all star voting process. 
findings:
    - Achieved recall of 74% for 2021 season and 67% for 2022 season, capturing a majority of the All Stars selected for those seasons.
    - Looked at underrated players (false positives) and overrated players (false negatives) to show potential flaws and inconsistencies in the current voting process.
