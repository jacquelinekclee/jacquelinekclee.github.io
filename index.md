# 👋🏻 Welcome to my Portfolio!

Hello! I'm Jacqueline, an [AI and ML Ops Technical Sales Engineer at IBM](experience). I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Data Science and minors in Economics and Business in 2023. Here, you'll find details on my favorite Data Science projects, my [work experience](experience), and my [education](education). 

During my undergraduate career, I [interned](experience) at large manufacturer TE Connectivity on their Data Science and Advanced Analytics team and sports media tech startup BallerTV on their Engineering team. On [campus](education), I participated in student government, representing the 40,000+ students at UC San Diego in funding decisions, and pro-bono consulting, working with local San Diego small businesses.  

Since starting my Data Science journey back in 2019, I've loved using data and data science to explore my personal interests, like [rap music](hiphop) and topics that could have an impact on the world, like [preventative health care](twas). 

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and baking, traveling, basketball, and concert-going. Click the links in the menu to learn more about my background and experience.
