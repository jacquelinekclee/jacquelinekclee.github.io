# 👋🏻 Welcome to my Portfolio!

Hello! I'm Jacqueline, a UC San Diego alum with a B.S. in Data Science and minors in Economics and Business currently working as a [Business Automation Technical Sales Engineer at IBM](experience).

Here, you'll find details on my favorite Data Science projects, my [work experience](experience), and my [education](education). Since starting my Data Science journey back in 2019, I've loved using data and data science to explore my personal interests, like [rap music](hiphop-nlp) and topics that could have an impact on the world, like [preventative health care](capstone-genetics).
