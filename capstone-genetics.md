# ðŸ§¬ Bash/Python/ETL/Regression â€“ Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies for Finding Genes Associated with IBD</h4>

This was my capstone project completed as part of getting my [B.S. in Data Science at UC San Diego]({{site.baseurl}}/education) with 3 other classmates. We leveraged Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies to identify genes that are associated with irritable bowel disease using various genetic data, bioinformatics tools, and simple linear regression. In the end, we identified 7 genes that are highly associated with IBD. Such techniques have implications for preventative healthcare, in which they could be employed to help diagnose individuals before onset of symptoms/disease. 

View [this website](https://notsamzhou.github.io/twas/) for summary of the data, methods, and results of the project, the [report](https://notsamzhou.github.io/twas/files/report.pdf) for full details on our work and findings, and this [repository](https://github.com/jacquelinekclee/twas-dsc180-a17) for all the code, including how to reproduce the project.

See below or [this link]({{site.baseurl}}/capstone-poster.pdf) for the project poster, which provides a nice overview and visualizations of the work we did and our findings.
