role: Tutors were my lifeline when learning how to code, so I wanted to be the same for fellow Triton Data Scientists. I tutored DSC 20 - Programming and Basic Data Structures for Data Science (Python) for 5 terms (Fall 2020-Fall 2021 and Winter 2023) and DSC 30 - Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science (Java) during Spring Quarter 2022. 
accomplishment1: Enhanced 500+ students' Python and Java skills in topics like object-oriented programming, recursion, and data structures by helping them understand assignments and coding logic during 4 weekly office hours. 
accomplishment2: Reinforced lecture material through creating weekly quizzes, moderated the question and answer forum to resolve students’ issues, and contributed to the creation of programming assignments.
technologies: Python, Java
